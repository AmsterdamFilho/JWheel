# JWheel

A template and set of code and components to help build Java applications faster, specially when using the Swing framework.

Its main benefit is helping desktop applications developers to build their software using a ready to use template, so they can focus in solving the business problems, not on user interface details. It can be specially helpful for ERP and simple CRUD and Report applications.

It will also have some general purpose Java utility classes, that can be used in any Java project.

So, if youâ€™re developing a desktop application and is not worried about a rich user interface, you can use this library, avoiding to spend time developing a CRUD template. After all, why would you reinvent JWheel?
