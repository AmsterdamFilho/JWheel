# JWheel

A template and set of code and components to help build Java applications faster, specially when using JavaFX.

Its main benefit is helping desktop applications developers to build their software using a ready to use template, so they can focus in solving the business problems. Since it is JavaFX, users can easily customize it with their own style sheets, while still using the template. It can be specially helpful for simple CRUD and Report applications.

It will also have some general purpose Java utility classes, that can be used in any Java project.

So, if you're developing a Java application and to save yourself some time, maybe this is what you need. After all, why would you reinvent JWheel?
